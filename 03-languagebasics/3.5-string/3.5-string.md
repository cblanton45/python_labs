## STEP 1: Examine 3.4-string.py file

This file will contain a stub for our editor.

Load this in your favorite text editor, ide, or spysder.

## Step 2: Clean text
**==> Cleanup the following text.**  

```python
text = "I-AM-SAM,-I-AM-SAM,SAM-I-AM!.THAT-SAM-I-AM!-THAT-SAM-I-AM!-I-DO-NOT-LIKE-THAT-SAM-I-AM. WOULD-YOU-LIKE-GREEN-EGGS-AND-HAM?"
```

## Step 3: Extract the words and print one word per line.

First, split by space.

Then, split by non-alphabetic.

**=> Now print the words one per line**   

## Step 4 : Detect phone numbers
Let's extract the phone numbers from text.

Write a phone number regex for your area.  
```
123-456-7890

# here \\d represents a digit
"\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d"
```

Here is the text, extract the phone numbers.
```python
text="""
We are located at 123 Main St.
you can reach customer services at 800-123-4567.
Our security is available 24x7 at   333-444-5555.
"""

phone_regex = "???"


```

## Step 5 : Baby Names
Let's do a fun lab analyzing baby names in US.  This dataset is made available by Social Security Administration.

We are going to load baby name from a file.

```python
babynames = []
with open('../data/babynames/babynames.txt', 'r') as f:
    babynames = f.read().splitlines()
```

**=> How many entries are in `names`**   

**=> Count how popular is your name :-)**

**=> Calculate length of baby names**

**=> calculate max/min of name_length**

**=> Find some of these lengthy baby names**
