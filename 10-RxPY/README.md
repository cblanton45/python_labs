## event_loop

```bash
python event_loop.py

```console
wait for 2 seconds at 23:55:15
waited for 2 seconds at 23:55:17
```

## http_echo

```bash
python http_echo.py
```

In a browser navigate to the location `http://localhost:8080/echo/hello` : 

You should see the string "hello" echoed back.

You can go back to your terminal and say control-c to exit the web server.
