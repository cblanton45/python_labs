3.5 Files
===========
### Overview
- file manipulation
- Command line parameters

### Depends On
None

### Run time
15-20 mins

### Working directory

---

## STEP 1: Examine 3.5-files.py file

This file will contain a stub for our editor.

Load this in your favorite text editor, ide, or spyder.

## Step 2: Command Line Parameters

Load command line parameters.

This is sys.argv.

**=> TODO: How would you check to make sure that the number of command line parameters is correct?**

HINT: use len() on sys.argv

## Step 3: Load the file

We use a with block so we don't have to close our file


```python

with open(filename, 'r') as myfile:
    for line in myfile:
        print(line)
```

## Step 4: Check for Errors

Note that we aren't checking for errors!  How would we check ffor errors

```python

try:
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
       # DO SOMETHING
except IOError:
    print "Could not read file:", filename
```

## Step 5: Search for String within file

Only print the string if it matches a condition.

For example, only print the string if it contains the word "python"


## Step 6: Load a CSV file

We can also try to load a CSV file. To do this, we need the csv package. 
We will see another, easier way to do this later with the panas package.

```python
with open(filename, 'rb') as myfile:
     myfilereader = csv.reader(myfile, delimter=',')
     for row in myfilereader:
          print(' '.join(row))
```

**=> Load the file '../data/rainfall/rainfall.csv'**

## Step 7: 

Use the CSV reader to find rows where the second column (the month) is "Jan"
